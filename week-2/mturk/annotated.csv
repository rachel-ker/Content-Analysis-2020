1,A2VR9DURGIYET3,"  Our Little Brother Eric I imagine seeing his future, taking his kids to a game at Cal Berkeley where we both played.  I imagine seeing his job as a firemen becoming a lifelong family and the career he hoped.  I imagine being there for when he and his wife celebrate their 25th anniversary and not just their first.  I imagine taking a walk with him around a house that has since become his home.  I imagine him teaching my kids about how great of a big brother I was and reminiscing with him about a simpler time.  Then I wake up from these dreams and the nightmare has just begun.      Diagnosis ALS   When you are diagnosed with ALS you are forced to see the future before you and realize that all your dreams have vanished.  That each day you must appreciate a basic skill before it has been taken from you. Life expectancy is 2-5 years and paralysis comes much sooner.   Why does it happen?    We are still at the infancy of understanding this disease and there  has not  been any definitive cause. Can some point to the game of football with claims of cause, sure. But reality is, all you will be doing is grasping for an answer.  An answer that will never come.  I know my brother, I know he is a fighter and know he will bite his lip and fight!  As he sits up in the doctors chair, he asked  ‚ÄúHow do I fight it?‚Äù  That is where the nightmare takes hold. Because there is even less answers to this question than the one of cause.  As an athlete you want a game plan, as a firemen you want a protocol, as a human you want hope! But right now all I can do is look at him and pray.   Pray that he will be spared.   Pray that he will enjoy each day  Pray that he will know I will love him through all this.   Today, I have no answer to WHY it happens or WHAT to do, but I do have an answer for HOW you and I can help!  According to HuffPost.com, ‚ÄúALS is a very expensive disease, costing patients an estimated $300,000 a year. The majority of patients bankrupt their families with the costs, and an even larger number simply can‚Äôt afford the cost to  stay alive , so they don‚Äôt. Can you imagine - having to stop  BEING ALIVE  because it‚Äôs too expensive?‚Äù All proceeds will go towards Eric‚Äôs treatment and care and will help raise awareness of ALS. We are so grateful for everyone‚Äôs continued support.  The Stevens Family  Learn more about Eric and his Battle to #axeALS at his Facebook page, Team Stevens Nation.  ",Donate $10

2,A2U4BSCOQDN17X,"  Late on the night of October 4th, 2019, our beloved Pedro Ventura was outside of a nightclub in Asheville, North Carolina when a stranger fired many gunshots into the crowd. He was visiting town from Los Angeles for one night for a wedding, but the course of his life was changed forever.   Despite the presence of up to 300 people in the street, Pedro was the only person hit in the gunfire, and his injuries are severe. The bullet entered his body at the back of his neck and ended up in his C4 vertebra, shattering parts of his spine and severing his spinal cord, initially leaving him paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe on his own. It is a miracle that he is alive, and the progress he has already made towards recovery ‚Äì including regaining partial control of his breathing and movement in his shoulders ‚Äì has defied doctors' expectations.  The road to recovery for Pedro will be long, but he is dedicated to continuing his journey and living a full life. As we, his immediate family, are still in the wake of this devastating tragedy, it‚Äôs difficult to imagine what the future holds, but we know that Pedro will never cease to be the brilliant, beautiful, hardworking, and vivacious man that he is. We simply need to be able to support him along that journey.  We are asking for your help to cover the costs of hospital stays, rehabilitation facilities, and 24/7 care for Pedro as he transitions into a life that is different, but still his own. We also need help with housing, transportation, and food costs for our family as we support him during this time. Your support means the world to Pedro and to all of us.    About Pedro:  Pedro is a fighter, a light in this world and a joy to all those who know him. He has always been a pioneer, a brave young man who has consistently defied expectations. Pedro is a first-generation immigrant from the Dominican Republic who came to New York City at the age of four and was quickly recognized as among the brightest of his peers. Despite not speaking English when he arrived, he was placed in gifted and talented school programs almost immediately, went on to graduate from the prestigious Prep for Prep leadership development program, and became the first member of his family to go to college. After graduating with honors from Wesleyan University in 2010, he went on to establish a career in the music industry which has taken him from New York to Miami and now Los Angeles. Pedro has a deep passion for his work and has thrived by carving his own path, conducting business in English, Spanish, and Portuguese and booking concert tours and festival appearances around the world for artists of all kinds.   An incredibly dedicated friend, family member, worker, and partner, Pedro is always the first person to volunteer to help and always has the biggest smile on his face. His compassion for others is palpable, his creativity knows no bounds, and he is beloved by all those who know him. He is a truly remarkable person, and we know his journey to recovery will be no different. Thank you for keeping him in your thoughts, and for contributing what you can to help him with this next phase of his life.  ",No Donation

4,A2QGNZ4WU914YU,"   This is the most heartbreaking letter that a mother can ever write, but here I am telling you the story of my baby boy Robert. Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert (citeste scrisoarea in romana mai jos)   I carried my baby boy for 9 months, waiting him to come in our lives and meet his older sister Emily. Robert was born on October 1st. When I first held him in my arms I knew what it was like to feel fulfilled. 4 years after giving birth to our little girl Emilia, God has blessed us with a little boy. I brought Robert home and our family was complete.    It seems extremely unfair to think that  life could have a price . But yes, his only chance is this vaccine that can stop the illness  and costs $ 2.1 million. It is a huge amount, we never thought we would need to call for help, but this challenge is greater than we could have ever imagined.  Due to the degenerative nature of the disease, we are racing against time and appealing to family, friends, local and global community to raise funds for Robert's gene therapy.   As parents, we feel powerless because we can't afford to buy him this cure. I don‚Äôt know why life gives us such challenges, but I look into Robert's eyes and I know he came here for a reason. We would work as much as needed in order to gather this sum, but unfortunately there is a clock ticking and each day that passes, our son can loose some of his abilities and they can never be restored.    No child deserves to suffer, all children deserve to live and make this world a better place!   Please help us make his story known by sharing to your family, friends, and the world. Every dollar gets us closer to saving his life.    ______________________________________________________________________________  Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert.   Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita.   La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit ‚Äúamiotrofie spinala‚Äù. Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: ‚ÄúBoala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani‚Äù.   Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.  Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate‚Ä¶ si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta. Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert.   Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ douƒÉ treimi dintre to»õi copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator √Ænainte de v√¢rsta de trei ani.  Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca  viata ar putea avea un pret , dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina. Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.  2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata.    Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!  ______________________________________________________________________________  –≠—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–µ –¥—É—à–µ—Ä–∞–∑–¥–∏—Ä–∞—é—â–µ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –±—ã –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –º–∞—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–≥–æ –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–µ—Ç –∏ —è –¥–µ–ª—é—Å—å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–µ–π –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞.   –Ø –Ω–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –ø–æ–¥ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ–º –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–∞ –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ 9 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤, –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞—è –µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –≤ –Ω–∞—à –º–∏—Ä –∏ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏ —Å –Ω–∞–º–∏ –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ–π —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π. –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è 1 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è –≤ –ö–∏—à–∏–Ω–µ–≤–µ. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ —è –≤–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∞ –µ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É–∫–∞—Ö, —è –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, –∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Ç–µ–±—è. –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ 4 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞—à–µ–π –¥–µ–≤–æ—á–∫–∏ –≠–º–∏–ª–∏–∏, –ë–æ–≥ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–ª –Ω–∞—Å –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–º –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–æ–º. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–∑–ª–∏ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞ –¥–æ–º–æ–π, –∏ –Ω–∞—à–µ —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç—å–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –±–µ–∑–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–º.  –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –º–µ—Å—è—Ü –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º–µ —É –≤—Ä–∞—á–∞ –Ω–∞–º —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ –º—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ—Å—Ç –¥–ª—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑–∞ ¬´—Å–ø–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞–º–∏–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏—è¬ª. –Ø –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º—ã–π –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —è –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞-–ª–∏–±–æ —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–æ–π. –î–∞–∂–µ –ø—Ä–∏ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–∞—á –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª –¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞–º –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –Ω–µ –ø—É–≥–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å, –≤ –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫–µ Google –º—ã –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–∏–ª–∏: ¬´–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–∞–±–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä 1, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —É–±–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π –≤ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ –¥–æ 2 –ª–µ—Ç¬ª.  –Ø –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∏ –¥–æ –º–æ–∑–≥–∞ –∫–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —ç—Ç–∞ –±–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—å, –∫—Ä–∞–¥–µ—Ç –º–æ–µ–≥–æ —Å—ã–Ω–∞, —è –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –≤ –≥–ª—É–±–∏–Ω–µ –¥—É—à–∏ —è –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∏ 3 –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ—Å—Ç–∞ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ö, —á—Ç–æ–± —É–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è. –ü–æ–∫–∞ —É –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞, —è –Ω–∞–¥–µ—è–ª–∞—Å—å, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ, –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–µ, –ª—é–±–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑ –±—ã–ª–æ –±—ã –ª–µ–≥—á–µ –≤—ã–ª–µ—á–∏—Ç—å. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç, –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Å –æ–±—Ä—É—à–∏–ª–æ—Å—å –Ω–µ–±–æ. –ï–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ, —á—Ç–æ —è —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ–¥–ª–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç—å ... –∏ –Ω–µ—Ç, –Ω–µ –ø–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—é –∫ –Ω–∞–º, –∞ –∫ –Ω–∞—à–µ–º—É —Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–∫—É!

4,A1VR49TB3Q4BV8,"   This is the most heartbreaking letter that a mother can ever write, but here I am telling you the story of my baby boy Robert. Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert (citeste scrisoarea in romana mai jos)   I carried my baby boy for 9 months, waiting him to come in our lives and meet his older sister Emily. Robert was born on October 1st. When I first held him in my arms I knew what it was like to feel fulfilled. 4 years after giving birth to our little girl Emilia, God has blessed us with a little boy. I brought Robert home and our family was complete.    It seems extremely unfair to think that  life could have a price . But yes, his only chance is this vaccine that can stop the illness  and costs $ 2.1 million. It is a huge amount, we never thought we would need to call for help, but this challenge is greater than we could have ever imagined.  Due to the degenerative nature of the disease, we are racing against time and appealing to family, friends, local and global community to raise funds for Robert's gene therapy.   As parents, we feel powerless because we can't afford to buy him this cure. I don‚Äôt know why life gives us such challenges, but I look into Robert's eyes and I know he came here for a reason. We would work as much as needed in order to gather this sum, but unfortunately there is a clock ticking and each day that passes, our son can loose some of his abilities and they can never be restored.    No child deserves to suffer, all children deserve to live and make this world a better place!   Please help us make his story known by sharing to your family, friends, and the world. Every dollar gets us closer to saving his life.    ______________________________________________________________________________  Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert.   Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita.   La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit ‚Äúamiotrofie spinala‚Äù. Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: ‚ÄúBoala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani‚Äù.   Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.  Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate‚Ä¶ si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta. Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert.   Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ douƒÉ treimi dintre to»õi copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator √Ænainte de v√¢rsta de trei ani.  Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca  viata ar putea avea un pret , dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina. Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.  2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata.    Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!  ______________________________________________________________________________  –≠—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–µ –¥—É—à–µ—Ä–∞–∑–¥–∏—Ä–∞—é—â–µ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –±—ã –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –º–∞—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–≥–æ –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–µ—Ç –∏ —è –¥–µ–ª—é—Å—å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–µ–π –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞.   –Ø –Ω–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –ø–æ–¥ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ–º –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–∞ –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ 9 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤, –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞—è –µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –≤ –Ω–∞—à –º–∏—Ä –∏ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏ —Å –Ω–∞–º–∏ –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ–π —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π. –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è 1 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è –≤ –ö–∏—à–∏–Ω–µ–≤–µ. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ —è –≤–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∞ –µ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É–∫–∞—Ö, —è –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, –∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Ç–µ–±—è. –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ 4 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞—à–µ–π –¥–µ–≤–æ—á–∫–∏ –≠–º–∏–ª–∏–∏, –ë–æ–≥ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–ª –Ω–∞—Å –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–º –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–æ–º. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–∑–ª–∏ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞ –¥–æ–º–æ–π, –∏ –Ω–∞—à–µ —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç—å–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –±–µ–∑–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–º.  –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –º–µ—Å—è—Ü –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º–µ —É –≤—Ä–∞—á–∞ –Ω–∞–º —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ –º—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ—Å—Ç –¥–ª—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑–∞ ¬´—Å–ø–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞–º–∏–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏—è¬ª. –Ø –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º—ã–π –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —è –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞-–ª–∏–±–æ —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–æ–π. –î–∞–∂–µ –ø—Ä–∏ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–∞—á –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª –¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞–º –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –Ω–µ –ø—É–≥–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å, –≤ –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫–µ Google –º—ã –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–∏–ª–∏: ¬´–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–∞–±–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä 1, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —É–±–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π –≤ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ –¥–æ 2 –ª–µ—Ç¬ª.  –Ø –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∏ –¥–æ –º–æ–∑–≥–∞ –∫–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —ç—Ç–∞ –±–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—å, –∫—Ä–∞–¥–µ—Ç –º–æ–µ–≥–æ —Å—ã–Ω–∞, —è –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –≤ –≥–ª—É–±–∏–Ω–µ –¥—É—à–∏ —è –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∏ 3 –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ—Å—Ç–∞ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ö, —á—Ç–æ–± —É–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è. –ü–æ–∫–∞ —É –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞, —è –Ω–∞–¥–µ—è–ª–∞—Å—å, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ, –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–µ, –ª—é–±–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑ –±—ã–ª–æ –±—ã –ª–µ–≥—á–µ –≤—ã–ª–µ—á–∏—Ç—å. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç, –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Å –æ–±—Ä—É—à–∏–ª–æ—Å—å –Ω–µ–±–æ. –ï–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ, —á—Ç–æ —è —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ–¥–ª–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç—å ... –∏ –Ω–µ—Ç, –Ω–µ –ø–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—é –∫ –Ω–∞–º, –∞ –∫ –Ω–∞—à–µ–º—É —Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–∫—É!

4,AKMQH2MGTUWO9,"   This is the most heartbreaking letter that a mother can ever write, but here I am telling you the story of my baby boy Robert. Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert (citeste scrisoarea in romana mai jos)   I carried my baby boy for 9 months, waiting him to come in our lives and meet his older sister Emily. Robert was born on October 1st. When I first held him in my arms I knew what it was like to feel fulfilled. 4 years after giving birth to our little girl Emilia, God has blessed us with a little boy. I brought Robert home and our family was complete.    It seems extremely unfair to think that  life could have a price . But yes, his only chance is this vaccine that can stop the illness  and costs $ 2.1 million. It is a huge amount, we never thought we would need to call for help, but this challenge is greater than we could have ever imagined.  Due to the degenerative nature of the disease, we are racing against time and appealing to family, friends, local and global community to raise funds for Robert's gene therapy.   As parents, we feel powerless because we can't afford to buy him this cure. I don‚Äôt know why life gives us such challenges, but I look into Robert's eyes and I know he came here for a reason. We would work as much as needed in order to gather this sum, but unfortunately there is a clock ticking and each day that passes, our son can loose some of his abilities and they can never be restored.    No child deserves to suffer, all children deserve to live and make this world a better place!   Please help us make his story known by sharing to your family, friends, and the world. Every dollar gets us closer to saving his life.    ______________________________________________________________________________  Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert.   Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita.   La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit ‚Äúamiotrofie spinala‚Äù. Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: ‚ÄúBoala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani‚Äù.   Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.  Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate‚Ä¶ si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta. Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert.   Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ douƒÉ treimi dintre to»õi copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator √Ænainte de v√¢rsta de trei ani.  Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca  viata ar putea avea un pret , dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina. Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.  2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata.    Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!  ______________________________________________________________________________  –≠—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–µ –¥—É—à–µ—Ä–∞–∑–¥–∏—Ä–∞—é—â–µ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –±—ã –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –º–∞—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–≥–æ –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–µ—Ç –∏ —è –¥–µ–ª—é—Å—å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–µ–π –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞.   –Ø –Ω–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –ø–æ–¥ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ–º –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–∞ –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ 9 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤, –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞—è –µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –≤ –Ω–∞—à –º–∏—Ä –∏ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏ —Å –Ω–∞–º–∏ –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ–π —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π. –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è 1 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è –≤ –ö–∏—à–∏–Ω–µ–≤–µ. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ —è –≤–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∞ –µ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É–∫–∞—Ö, —è –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, –∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Ç–µ–±—è. –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ 4 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞—à–µ–π –¥–µ–≤–æ—á–∫–∏ –≠–º–∏–ª–∏–∏, –ë–æ–≥ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–ª –Ω–∞—Å –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–º –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–æ–º. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–∑–ª–∏ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞ –¥–æ–º–æ–π, –∏ –Ω–∞—à–µ —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç—å–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –±–µ–∑–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–º.  –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –º–µ—Å—è—Ü –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º–µ —É –≤—Ä–∞—á–∞ –Ω–∞–º —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ –º—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ—Å—Ç –¥–ª—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑–∞ ¬´—Å–ø–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞–º–∏–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏—è¬ª. –Ø –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º—ã–π –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —è –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞-–ª–∏–±–æ —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–æ–π. –î–∞–∂–µ –ø—Ä–∏ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–∞—á –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª –¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞–º –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –Ω–µ –ø—É–≥–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å, –≤ –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫–µ Google –º—ã –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–∏–ª–∏: ¬´–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–∞–±–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä 1, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —É–±–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π –≤ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ –¥–æ 2 –ª–µ—Ç¬ª.  –Ø –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∏ –¥–æ –º–æ–∑–≥–∞ –∫–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —ç—Ç–∞ –±–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—å, –∫—Ä–∞–¥–µ—Ç –º–æ–µ–≥–æ —Å—ã–Ω–∞, —è –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –≤ –≥–ª—É–±–∏–Ω–µ –¥—É—à–∏ —è –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∏ 3 –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ—Å—Ç–∞ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ö, —á—Ç–æ–± —É–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è. –ü–æ–∫–∞ —É –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞, —è –Ω–∞–¥–µ—è–ª–∞—Å—å, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ, –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–µ, –ª—é–±–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑ –±—ã–ª–æ –±—ã –ª–µ–≥—á–µ –≤—ã–ª–µ—á–∏—Ç—å. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç, –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Å –æ–±—Ä—É—à–∏–ª–æ—Å—å –Ω–µ–±–æ. –ï–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ, —á—Ç–æ —è —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ–¥–ª–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç—å ... –∏ –Ω–µ—Ç, –Ω–µ –ø–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—é –∫ –Ω–∞–º, –∞ –∫ –Ω–∞—à–µ–º—É —Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–∫—É!

4,A2G92T4A1U377C,"   This is the most heartbreaking letter that a mother can ever write, but here I am telling you the story of my baby boy Robert. Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert (citeste scrisoarea in romana mai jos)   I carried my baby boy for 9 months, waiting him to come in our lives and meet his older sister Emily. Robert was born on October 1st. When I first held him in my arms I knew what it was like to feel fulfilled. 4 years after giving birth to our little girl Emilia, God has blessed us with a little boy. I brought Robert home and our family was complete.    It seems extremely unfair to think that  life could have a price . But yes, his only chance is this vaccine that can stop the illness  and costs $ 2.1 million. It is a huge amount, we never thought we would need to call for help, but this challenge is greater than we could have ever imagined.  Due to the degenerative nature of the disease, we are racing against time and appealing to family, friends, local and global community to raise funds for Robert's gene therapy.   As parents, we feel powerless because we can't afford to buy him this cure. I don‚Äôt know why life gives us such challenges, but I look into Robert's eyes and I know he came here for a reason. We would work as much as needed in order to gather this sum, but unfortunately there is a clock ticking and each day that passes, our son can loose some of his abilities and they can never be restored.    No child deserves to suffer, all children deserve to live and make this world a better place!   Please help us make his story known by sharing to your family, friends, and the world. Every dollar gets us closer to saving his life.    ______________________________________________________________________________  Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert.   Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita.   La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit ‚Äúamiotrofie spinala‚Äù. Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: ‚ÄúBoala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani‚Äù.   Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.  Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate‚Ä¶ si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta. Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert.   Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ douƒÉ treimi dintre to»õi copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator √Ænainte de v√¢rsta de trei ani.  Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca  viata ar putea avea un pret , dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina. Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.  2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata.    Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!  ______________________________________________________________________________  –≠—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–µ –¥—É—à–µ—Ä–∞–∑–¥–∏—Ä–∞—é—â–µ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –±—ã –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –º–∞—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–≥–æ –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–µ—Ç –∏ —è –¥–µ–ª—é—Å—å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–µ–π –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞.   –Ø –Ω–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –ø–æ–¥ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ–º –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–∞ –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ 9 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤, –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞—è –µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –≤ –Ω–∞—à –º–∏—Ä –∏ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏ —Å –Ω–∞–º–∏ –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ–π —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π. –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è 1 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è –≤ –ö–∏—à–∏–Ω–µ–≤–µ. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ —è –≤–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∞ –µ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É–∫–∞—Ö, —è –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, –∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Ç–µ–±—è. –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ 4 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞—à–µ–π –¥–µ–≤–æ—á–∫–∏ –≠–º–∏–ª–∏–∏, –ë–æ–≥ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–ª –Ω–∞—Å –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–º –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–æ–º. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–∑–ª–∏ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞ –¥–æ–º–æ–π, –∏ –Ω–∞—à–µ —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç—å–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –±–µ–∑–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–º.  –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –º–µ—Å—è—Ü –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º–µ —É –≤—Ä–∞—á–∞ –Ω–∞–º —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ –º—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ—Å—Ç –¥–ª—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑–∞ ¬´—Å–ø–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞–º–∏–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏—è¬ª. –Ø –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º—ã–π –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —è –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞-–ª–∏–±–æ —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–æ–π. –î–∞–∂–µ –ø—Ä–∏ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–∞—á –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª –¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞–º –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –Ω–µ –ø—É–≥–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å, –≤ –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫–µ Google –º—ã –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–∏–ª–∏: ¬´–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–∞–±–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä 1, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —É–±–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π –≤ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ –¥–æ 2 –ª–µ—Ç¬ª.  –Ø –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∏ –¥–æ –º–æ–∑–≥–∞ –∫–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —ç—Ç–∞ –±–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—å, –∫—Ä–∞–¥–µ—Ç –º–æ–µ–≥–æ —Å—ã–Ω–∞, —è –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –≤ –≥–ª—É–±–∏–Ω–µ –¥—É—à–∏ —è –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∏ 3 –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ—Å—Ç–∞ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ö, —á—Ç–æ–± —É–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è. –ü–æ–∫–∞ —É –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞, —è –Ω–∞–¥–µ—è–ª–∞—Å—å, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ, –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–µ, –ª—é–±–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑ –±—ã–ª–æ –±—ã –ª–µ–≥—á–µ –≤—ã–ª–µ—á–∏—Ç—å. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç, –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Å –æ–±—Ä—É—à–∏–ª–æ—Å—å –Ω–µ–±–æ. –ï–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ, —á—Ç–æ —è —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ–¥–ª–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç—å ... –∏ –Ω–µ—Ç, –Ω–µ –ø–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—é –∫ –Ω–∞–º, –∞ –∫ –Ω–∞—à–µ–º—É —Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–∫—É!

4,A2JP9IKRHNLRPI,"   This is the most heartbreaking letter that a mother can ever write, but here I am telling you the story of my baby boy Robert. Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert (citeste scrisoarea in romana mai jos)   I carried my baby boy for 9 months, waiting him to come in our lives and meet his older sister Emily. Robert was born on October 1st. When I first held him in my arms I knew what it was like to feel fulfilled. 4 years after giving birth to our little girl Emilia, God has blessed us with a little boy. I brought Robert home and our family was complete.    It seems extremely unfair to think that  life could have a price . But yes, his only chance is this vaccine that can stop the illness  and costs $ 2.1 million. It is a huge amount, we never thought we would need to call for help, but this challenge is greater than we could have ever imagined.  Due to the degenerative nature of the disease, we are racing against time and appealing to family, friends, local and global community to raise funds for Robert's gene therapy.   As parents, we feel powerless because we can't afford to buy him this cure. I don‚Äôt know why life gives us such challenges, but I look into Robert's eyes and I know he came here for a reason. We would work as much as needed in order to gather this sum, but unfortunately there is a clock ticking and each day that passes, our son can loose some of his abilities and they can never be restored.    No child deserves to suffer, all children deserve to live and make this world a better place!   Please help us make his story known by sharing to your family, friends, and the world. Every dollar gets us closer to saving his life.    ______________________________________________________________________________  Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert.   Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita.   La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit ‚Äúamiotrofie spinala‚Äù. Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: ‚ÄúBoala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani‚Äù.   Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.  Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate‚Ä¶ si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta. Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert.   Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ douƒÉ treimi dintre to»õi copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator √Ænainte de v√¢rsta de trei ani.  Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca  viata ar putea avea un pret , dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina. Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.  2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata.    Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!  ______________________________________________________________________________  –≠—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–µ –¥—É—à–µ—Ä–∞–∑–¥–∏—Ä–∞—é—â–µ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –±—ã –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –º–∞—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–≥–æ –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–µ—Ç –∏ —è –¥–µ–ª—é—Å—å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–µ–π –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞.   –Ø –Ω–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –ø–æ–¥ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ–º –º–æ–µ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–∞ –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ 9 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤, –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞—è –µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –≤ –Ω–∞—à –º–∏—Ä –∏ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏ —Å –Ω–∞–º–∏ –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ–π —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π. –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è 1 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è –≤ –ö–∏—à–∏–Ω–µ–≤–µ. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ —è –≤–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∞ –µ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É–∫–∞—Ö, —è –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, –∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ —ç—Ç–æ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Ç–µ–±—è. –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ 4 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞—à–µ–π –¥–µ–≤–æ—á–∫–∏ –≠–º–∏–ª–∏–∏, –ë–æ–≥ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–ª –Ω–∞—Å –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–º –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–æ–º. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–∑–ª–∏ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–∞ –¥–æ–º–æ–π, –∏ –Ω–∞—à–µ —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç—å–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –±–µ–∑–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–º.  –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –º–µ—Å—è—Ü –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º–µ —É –≤—Ä–∞—á–∞ –Ω–∞–º —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ –º—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ—Å—Ç –¥–ª—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑–∞ ¬´—Å–ø–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞–º–∏–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏—è¬ª. –Ø –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º—ã–π –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —è –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞-–ª–∏–±–æ —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–æ–π. –î–∞–∂–µ –ø—Ä–∏ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–∞—á –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª –¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞–º –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –Ω–µ –ø—É–≥–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å, –≤ –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫–µ Google –º—ã –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–∏–ª–∏: ¬´–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–∞–±–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä 1, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —É–±–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π –≤ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ –¥–æ 2 –ª–µ—Ç¬ª.  –Ø –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∏ –¥–æ –º–æ–∑–≥–∞ –∫–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —ç—Ç–∞ –±–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—å, –∫—Ä–∞–¥–µ—Ç –º–æ–µ–≥–æ —Å—ã–Ω–∞, —è –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç—å, –Ω–æ –≤ –≥–ª—É–±–∏–Ω–µ –¥—É—à–∏ —è –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞. –ú—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∏ 3 –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ—Å—Ç–∞ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ö, —á—Ç–æ–± —É–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è. –ü–æ–∫–∞ —É –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞, —è –Ω–∞–¥–µ—è–ª–∞—Å—å, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ, –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–µ, –ª—é–±–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ–∑ –±—ã–ª–æ –±—ã –ª–µ–≥—á–µ –≤—ã–ª–µ—á–∏—Ç—å. –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç, –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Å –æ–±—Ä—É—à–∏–ª–æ—Å—å –Ω–µ–±–æ. –ï–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ, —á—Ç–æ —è —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞, —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ–¥–ª–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç—å ... –∏ –Ω–µ—Ç, –Ω–µ –ø–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—é –∫ –Ω–∞–º, –∞ –∫ –Ω–∞—à–µ–º—É —Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–∫—É!

5,A2JP9IKRHNLRPI,"  On Tuesday, Dec 17, Amber VanVickle was diagnosed with stage IV cancer in her colon, lungs and liver that will require immediate, intensive treatment.   Amber and Dave are a beautiful example of holiness, trusting in God, and love. They have 5 amazing children, two of whom have a variety of special medical needs.      Right now there‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty, but if you know Amber and Dave at all, one thing is certain.  They will glorify and magnify God in this new trial.    9 years ago Dave began working as a full time Catholic Evangelist, because he answered the Lord‚Äôs call to work in a parish and this was a financial leap of faith and trust in the Lord for their family.   Amber is an amazing wife and mom who puts her faith in Christ first and foremost in everything she does. She lovingly homeschools all but one of their kids.   Already facing high expenses and medical treatments for their kids with special needs, Dave often travels and speaks around the country. He‚Äôs one of the hardest working guys I have ever met.   Personally, I can‚Äôt imagine the range of emotions and thoughts they are facing. I want to ask people to pray and fast in earnest for them. I know God will be glorified in this family as he already is.   Secondly, I know people want to help. I believe we can help relieve at least some of the burden by helping financially. Even before this medical crisis, their bills were high. Let‚Äôs come together as the Body of Christ and rally around the VanVickles so Dave doesn‚Äôt have to travel as much and they can both focus on their family during this crisis.    Thank you for whatever help you can give. It‚Äôs always humbling to ask for help, but as I said above, I know that God will be glorified in this. The VanVickles are fighters.

I know God will be glorified in this family as he already is.   Secondly, I know people want to help. I believe we can help relieve at least some of the burden by helping financially. Even before this medical crisis, their bills were high. Let‚Äôs come together as the Body of Christ and rally around the VanVickles so Dave doesn‚Äôt have to travel as much and they can both focus on their family during this crisis.    Thank you for whatever help you can give. It‚Äôs always humbling to ask for help, but as I said above, I know that God will be glorified in this. The VanVickles are fighters.    Dear cancer and Satan, please prepare to have your asses kicked.  ",Donate $5

6,A1C42B3V15RM9U,"  Imagine moving from a diagnosis of ‚Äúsevere‚Äù autism to no longer meeting the criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  The recently completed Microbiota Transplant Therapy (MTT) Phase 1 study indicates such results are possible and sustainable.    At the beginning of the study, 83% of participants were classified as ‚Äúsevere‚Äù on an autism diagnosis scale. At a 2 year follow up, only 17% were still ‚Äúsevere‚Äù, and 44% no longer met the criteria for an autism diagnosis. Most participants had significant improvements in core autism symptoms and gastrointestinal problems.   MTT holds great promise as a potential treatment for ASD. The next step towards FDA approval is a larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for children with ASD. (We are also conducting a separate study for adults with ASD, and the fundraising for that study is complete).  We need your help to move this research forward. We need to raise $900,000 to start the study and treat 50 children with ASD.  An anonymous donor has pledged $100,000 in matching funds, so the first set of donations will be doubled!  Donations via GoFundMe are being sent to the Autism Nutrition Research Center (ANRC) because ASU cannot receive funds directly from GoFundMe.  ANRC is a 501¬©3 non-profit led by Prof. Adams which raises funds for autism research, and pledges that 100% of the funds received from GoFundMe will be sent to ASU to support this research.

Several wilderness first aid responders immediately came to her care, and with the help of the surrounding climbers in the area, Lizzy was able to get quick medical care at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock trauma center within two hours of her fall. We cannot thank the people there that day enough for their rapid response, support, and care in her rescue and immediate treatment.   Those of you who know her would not be surprised to hear that even in the first moments after her fall, Lizzy was taking charge of the situation, calming those around her and walking through next steps, and talking about a future in adaptive cycling. She was level-headed and brave during her entire rescue.   Lizzy has sustained a serious spinal cord injury to her T4 and T5 vertebrae and can no longer user her legs. This is a life-altering injury, and we all know the medical expenses for her long term recovery will soon seem insurmountable. We know it is not easy to ask for help, but we want to be able to support Lizzy during a time when she truly needs us. Lizzy, her partner (Josh Grehan), her parents Margaret and Tim Ragan have a lot of challenges ahead.   The Christopher Reeve Foundation estimates that living with a spinal cord injury costs $518K in the first year. This fundraiser will help Lizzy get the best long term care possible and eventually help her get access to healing and resources that will ensure she maintains a mobile and independent life, i.e.:  - 1 month of in-patient rehabilitation followed by 3-6 months of dedicated outpatient rehab  - retrofitting Lizzy's apartment - wheelchair van - adaptive bike   Whether or not you‚Äôre able to make a donation, please consider sharing this fundraiser outward within your community at hand, and share with us a story below on how you got to know and love Lizzy!
