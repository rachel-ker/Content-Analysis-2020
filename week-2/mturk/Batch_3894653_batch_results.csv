Then I wake up from these dreams and the nightmare has just begun.      Diagnosis ALS   When you are diagnosed with ALS you are forced to see the future before you and realize that all your dreams have vanished.  That each day you must appreciate a basic skill before it has been taken from you. Life expectancy is 2-5 years and paralysis comes much sooner.   Why does it happen?    We are still at the infancy of understanding this disease and there  has not  been any definitive cause. Can some point to the game of football with claims of cause, sure. But reality is, all you will be doing is grasping for an answer.  An answer that will never come.  I know my brother, I know he is a fighter and know he will bite his lip and fight!  As he sits up in the doctors chair, he asked  “How do I fight it?”  That is where the nightmare takes hold. Because there is even less answers to this question than the one of cause.  As an athlete you want a game plan, as a firemen you want a protocol, as a human you want hope! But right now all I can do is look at him and pray.   Pray that he will be spared.   Pray that he will enjoy each day  Pray that he will know I will love him through all this.   Today, I have no answer to WHY it happens or WHAT to do, but I do have an answer for HOW you and I can help!  According to HuffPost.com, “ALS is a very expensive disease, costing patients an estimated $300,000 a year. The majority of patients bankrupt their families with the costs, and an even larger number simply can’t afford the cost to  stay alive , so they don’t. Can you imagine - having to stop  BEING ALIVE  because it’s too expensive?” All proceeds will go towards Eric’s treatment and care and will help raise awareness of ALS.

He was visiting town from Los Angeles for one night for a wedding, but the course of his life was changed forever.   Despite the presence of up to 300 people in the street, Pedro was the only person hit in the gunfire, and his injuries are severe. The bullet entered his body at the back of his neck and ended up in his C4 vertebra, shattering parts of his spine and severing his spinal cord, initially leaving him paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe on his own. It is a miracle that he is alive, and the progress he has already made towards recovery – including regaining partial control of his breathing and movement in his shoulders – has defied doctors' expectations.  The road to recovery for Pedro will be long, but he is dedicated to continuing his journey and living a full life. As we, his immediate family, are still in the wake of this devastating tragedy, it’s difficult to imagine what the future holds, but we know that Pedro will never cease to be the brilliant, beautiful, hardworking, and vivacious man that he is. We simply need to be able to support him along that journey.  We are asking for your help to cover the costs of hospital stays, rehabilitation facilities, and 24/7 care for Pedro as he transitions into a life that is different, but still his own. We also need help with housing, transportation, and food costs for our family as we support him during this time. Your support means the world to Pedro and to all of us.    About Pedro:  Pedro is a fighter, a light in this world and a joy to all those who know him. He has always been a pioneer, a brave young man who has consistently defied expectations. Pedro is a first-generation immigrant from the Dominican Republic who came to New York City at the age of four and was quickly recognized as among the brightest of his peers. Despite not speaking English when he arrived, he was placed in gifted and talented school programs almost immediately, went on to graduate from the prestigious Prep for Prep leadership development program, and became the first member of his family to go to college. After graduating with honors from Wesleyan University in 2010, he went on to establish a career in the music industry which has taken him from New York to Miami and now Los Angeles. Pedro has a deep passion for his work and has thrived by carving his own path, conducting business in English, Spanish, and Portuguese and booking concert tours and festival appearances around the world for artists of all kinds.   An incredibly dedicated friend, family member, worker, and partner, Pedro is always the first person to volunteer to help and always has the biggest smile on his face. His compassion for others is palpable, his creativity knows no bounds, and he is beloved by all those who know him. He is a truly remarkable person, and we know his journey to recovery will be no different.

About Pedro:  Pedro is a fighter, a light in this world and a joy to all those who know him. He has always been a pioneer, a brave young man who has consistently defied expectations. Pedro is a first-generation immigrant from the Dominican Republic who came to New York City at the age of four and was quickly recognized as among the brightest of his peers. Despite not speaking English when he arrived, he was placed in gifted and talented school programs almost immediately, went on to graduate from the prestigious Prep for Prep leadership development program, and became the first member of his family to go to college. After graduating with honors from Wesleyan University in 2010, he went on to establish a career in the music industry which has taken him from New York to Miami and now Los Angeles. Pedro has a deep passion for his work and has thrived by carving his own path, conducting business in English, Spanish, and Portuguese and booking concert tours and festival appearances around the world for artists of all kinds.   An incredibly dedicated friend, family member, worker, and partner, Pedro is always the first person to volunteer to help and always has the biggest smile on his face. His compassion for others is palpable, his creativity knows no bounds, and he is beloved by all those who know him. He is a truly remarkable person, and we know his journey to recovery will be no different. Thank you for keeping him in your thoughts, and for contributing what you can to help him with this next phase of his life.  ","Donate $5"

He was visiting town from Los Angeles for one night for a wedding, but the course of his life was changed forever.   Despite the presence of up to 300 people in the street, Pedro was the only person hit in the gunfire, and his injuries are severe. The bullet entered his body at the back of his neck and ended up in his C4 vertebra, shattering parts of his spine and severing his spinal cord, initially leaving him paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe on his own. It is a miracle that he is alive, and the progress he has already made towards recovery – including regaining partial control of his breathing and movement in his shoulders – has defied doctors' expectations.  The road to recovery for Pedro will be long, but he is dedicated to continuing his journey and living a full life. As we, his immediate family, are still in the wake of this devastating tragedy, it’s difficult to imagine what the future holds, but we know that Pedro will never cease to be the brilliant, beautiful, hardworking, and vivacious man that he is. We simply need to be able to support him along that journey.

Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita.   La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit “amiotrofie spinala”. Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: “Boala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani”.   Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.  Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate… si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta. Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert.   Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ două treimi dintre toți copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator înainte de vârsta de trei ani.  Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca  viata ar putea avea un pret , dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina. Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.  2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata.    Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!  ______________________________________________________________________________  Это самое душераздирающее письмо, которое могла бы написать мать, но другого выхода нет и я делюсь историей моего малыша Роберта.   Я носила под сердцем моего маленького мальчика в течение 9 месяцев, ожидая его прихода в наш мир и встречи с нами и его старшей сестрой. Роберт родился 1 октября в Кишиневе. Когда я впервые держала его на руках, я знала, какого это когда любовь переполняет тебя. Через 4 года после рождения нашей девочки Эмилии, Бог благословил нас маленьким мальчиком. Мы привезли Роберта домой, и наше счастье было безграничным.  Через месяц после рождения, на приёме у врача нам сказали, что мы должны сделать генетический тест для определения диагноза «спинальная амиотрофия». Я знала, что самый большой страх, который я когда-либо чувствовала может оказаться правдой. Даже при том, что врач не хотел давать нам детали, чтобы не пугать нас, в поиске Google мы обнаружили: «Генетическое заболевание номер 1, которое убивает большинство детей в возрасте до 2 лет».  Я продолжала читать и до мозга костей чувствовала, что именно эта болезнь, крадет моего сына, я отказывалась верить, но в глубине души я понимала, что это правда. Мы провели 3 генетических теста в разных лабораториях, чтоб убедится. Пока у нас не было результата, я надеялась, что это, может быть, что-то другое, любой другой диагноз было бы легче вылечить. Когда мы получил первый результат, на нас обрушилось небо. Единственное, что я чувствовала, это несправедливость ... и нет, не по отношению к нам, а к нашему ребенку! Все шаги развития , которые с рождения мы проходим естественным путем, для Роберта - это борьба. Роберт должен бороться каждую секунду, чтобы дышать, есть, чтобы двигать каждой частью своего тела. Я чувствовала несправедливость и беспокойство за его ускользающее будущее, особенно в обществе, которое не преспособленно для людей с особыми потребностями. 5 лет назад нигде в мире не было лекарства от этой болезни. Дети были прикованы к постели, они дышали и ели по средством мед оборудования. Но теперь надежда и шанс на нормальную жизнь есть.  Спинальная амиотрофия поражает нейроны в спинном мозге, часто те, которые находятся в стволе мозга, что приводит к их смерти. Форма спинальной амиотрофии 1 является наиболее тяжелой с точки зрения эволюции и прогресса: около 2/3 всех детей с СМА типа 1 умирают от остановки дыхания до достижения возраста трех лет. Звучит как крик Небесам, думать, что жизнь может иметь цену, но да, его единственный шанс - эта вакцина которая может остановить болезнь и стоит она 2 100 000 долларов. Мы никогда не думали, что нам придется молить о помощь, но этот груз больше чем мы могли бы себе представить и осилить. Нет никакого другого лекарства, кроме как вакцина в Соединенных Штатах , которая останавливает болезнь. В качестве генной терапии ZOLGENSMA, предназначена для выявления основной причины мышечной атрофии позвоночника (SMA) путем замены функции отсутствующего или нефункционального гена SMN1 новой функциональной копией гена SMN.  2 миллиона евро - это огромная сумма, мы не знаем, есть ли шанс собрать эти деньги, но мы знаем, что сила и доброта людей безгранична, и мы не хотим отказываться верить и бороться. Я не знаю, почему жизнь дает нам такие испытания, но смотря в глаза Роберту я знаю, что он появился на этот свет не зря и может стать доказательством чуда. Это страшно, но мой материнский оптимизм заставляет меня поверить , что если 2 миллиона людей пожертвуют каждый по 1 евро, то у Роберта будет шанс на жизнь.  Не один ребенок не должен страдать и заслуживает шанс на жизнь чтоб сделать этот мир чуточку лучше!       ","Donate $10"

Когда я впервые держала его на руках, я знала, какого это когда любовь переполняет тебя. Через 4 года после рождения нашей девочки Эмилии, Бог благословил нас маленьким мальчиком. Мы привезли Роберта домой, и наше счастье было безграничным.  Через месяц после рождения, на приёме у врача нам сказали, что мы должны сделать генетический тест для определения диагноза «спинальная амиотрофия». Я знала, что самый большой страх, который я когда-либо чувствовала может оказаться правдой. Даже при том, что врач не хотел давать нам детали, чтобы не пугать нас, в поиске Google мы обнаружили: «Генетическое заболевание номер 1, которое убивает большинство детей в возрасте до 2 лет».  Я продолжала читать и до мозга костей чувствовала, что именно эта болезнь, крадет моего сына, я отказывалась верить, но в глубине души я понимала, что это правда. Мы провели 3 генетических теста в разных лабораториях, чтоб убедится. Пока у нас не было результата, я надеялась, что это, может быть, что-то другое, любой другой диагноз было бы легче вылечить. Когда мы получил первый результат, на нас обрушилось небо. Единственное, что я чувствовала, это несправедливость ... и нет, не по отношению к нам, а к нашему ребенку! Все шаги развития , которые с рождения мы проходим естественным путем, для Роберта - это борьба. Роберт должен бороться каждую секунду, чтобы дышать, есть, чтобы двигать каждой частью своего тела. Я чувствовала несправедливость и беспокойство за его ускользающее будущее, особенно в обществе, которое не преспособленно для людей с особыми потребностями. 5 лет назад нигде в мире не было лекарства от этой болезни. Дети были прикованы к постели, они дышали и ели по средством мед оборудования. Но теперь надежда и шанс на нормальную жизнь есть.  Спинальная амиотрофия поражает нейроны в спинном мозге, часто те, которые находятся в стволе мозга, что приводит к их смерти. Форма спинальной амиотрофии 1 является наиболее тяжелой с точки зрения эволюции и прогресса: около 2/3 всех детей с СМА типа 1 умирают от остановки дыхания до достижения возраста трех лет. Звучит как крик Небесам, думать, что жизнь может иметь цену, но да, его единственный шанс - эта вакцина которая может остановить болезнь и стоит она 2 100 000 долларов. Мы никогда не думали, что нам придется молить о помощь, но этот груз больше чем мы могли бы себе представить и осилить. Нет никакого другого лекарства, кроме как вакцина в Соединенных Штатах , которая останавливает болезнь. В качестве генной терапии ZOLGENSMA, предназначена для выявления основной причины мышечной атрофии позвоночника (SMA) путем замены функции отсутствующего или нефункционального гена SMN1 новой функциональной копией гена SMN.  2 миллиона евро - это огромная сумма, мы не знаем, есть ли шанс собрать эти деньги, но мы знаем, что сила и доброта людей безгранична, и мы не хотим отказываться верить и бороться. Я не знаю, почему жизнь дает нам такие испытания, но смотря в глаза Роберту я знаю, что он появился на этот свет не зря и может стать доказательством чуда. Это страшно, но мой материнский оптимизм заставляет меня поверить , что если 2 миллиона людей пожертвуют каждый по 1 евро, то у Роберта будет шанс на жизнь.  Не один ребенок не должен страдать и заслуживает шанс на жизнь чтоб сделать этот мир чуточку лучше!       ","Donate $10"

Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita.   La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit “amiotrofie spinala”. Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: “Boala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani”.   Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.  Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate… si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta. Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert.   Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ două treimi dintre toți copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator înainte de vârsta de trei ani.  Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca  viata ar putea avea un pret , dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina. Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.  2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata.

Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.  2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata.    Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!  ______________________________________________________________________________  Это самое душераздирающее письмо, которое могла бы написать мать, но другого выхода нет и я делюсь историей моего малыша Роберта.   Я носила под сердцем моего маленького мальчика в течение 9 месяцев, ожидая его прихода в наш мир и встречи с нами и его старшей сестрой. Роберт родился 1 октября в Кишиневе. Когда я впервые держала его на руках, я знала, какого это когда любовь переполняет тебя. Через 4 года после рождения нашей девочки Эмилии, Бог благословил нас маленьким мальчиком. Мы привезли Роберта домой, и наше счастье было безграничным.  Через месяц после рождения, на приёме у врача нам сказали, что мы должны сделать генетический тест для определения диагноза «спинальная амиотрофия». Я знала, что самый большой страх, который я когда-либо чувствовала может оказаться правдой. Даже при том, что врач не хотел давать нам детали, чтобы не пугать нас, в поиске Google мы обнаружили: «Генетическое заболевание номер 1, которое убивает большинство детей в возрасте до 2 лет».  Я продолжала читать и до мозга костей чувствовала, что именно эта болезнь, крадет моего сына, я отказывалась верить, но в глубине души я понимала, что это правда. Мы провели 3 генетических теста в разных лабораториях, чтоб убедится. Пока у нас не было результата, я надеялась, что это, может быть, что-то другое, любой другой диагноз было бы легче вылечить. Когда мы получил первый результат, на нас обрушилось небо. Единственное, что я чувствовала, это несправедливость ... и нет, не по отношению к нам, а к нашему ребенку! Все шаги развития , которые с рождения мы проходим естественным путем, для Роберта - это борьба. Роберт должен бороться каждую секунду, чтобы дышать, есть, чтобы двигать каждой частью своего тела. Я чувствовала несправедливость и беспокойство за его ускользающее будущее, особенно в обществе, которое не преспособленно для людей с особыми потребностями. 5 лет назад нигде в мире не было лекарства от этой болезни. Дети были прикованы к постели, они дышали и ели по средством мед оборудования. Но теперь надежда и шанс на нормальную жизнь есть.  Спинальная амиотрофия поражает нейроны в спинном мозге, часто те, которые находятся в стволе мозга, что приводит к их смерти. Форма спинальной амиотрофии 1 является наиболее тяжелой с точки зрения эволюции и прогресса: около 2/3 всех детей с СМА типа 1 умирают от остановки дыхания до достижения возраста трех лет. Звучит как крик Небесам, думать, что жизнь может иметь цену, но да, его единственный шанс - эта вакцина которая может остановить болезнь и стоит она 2 100 000 долларов. Мы никогда не думали, что нам придется молить о помощь, но этот груз больше чем мы могли бы себе представить и осилить. Нет никакого другого лекарства, кроме как вакцина в Соединенных Штатах , которая останавливает болезнь. В качестве генной терапии ZOLGENSMA, предназначена для выявления основной причины мышечной атрофии позвоночника (SMA) путем замены функции отсутствующего или нефункционального гена SMN1 новой функциональной копией гена SMN.  2 миллиона евро - это огромная сумма, мы не знаем, есть ли шанс собрать эти деньги, но мы знаем, что сила и доброта людей безгранична, и мы не хотим отказываться верить и бороться. Я не знаю, почему жизнь дает нам такие испытания, но смотря в глаза Роберту я знаю, что он появился на этот свет не зря и может стать доказательством чуда. Это страшно, но мой материнский оптимизм заставляет меня поверить , что если 2 миллиона людей пожертвуют каждый по 1 евро, то у Роберта будет шанс на жизнь.  Не один ребенок не должен страдать и заслуживает шанс на жизнь чтоб сделать этот мир чуточку лучше!       ","Donate $10"

The recently completed Microbiota Transplant Therapy (MTT) Phase 1 study indicates such results are possible and sustainable.    At the beginning of the study, 83% of participants were classified as “severe” on an autism diagnosis scale. At a 2 year follow up, only 17% were still “severe”, and 44% no longer met the criteria for an autism diagnosis. Most participants had significant improvements in core autism symptoms and gastrointestinal problems.   MTT holds great promise as a potential treatment for ASD. The next step towards FDA approval is a larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for children with ASD. (We are also conducting a separate study for adults with ASD, and the fundraising for that study is complete).  We need your help to move this research forward. We need to raise $900,000 to start the study and treat 50 children with ASD.  An anonymous donor has pledged $100,000 in matching funds, so the first set of donations will be doubled!  Donations via GoFundMe are being sent to the Autism Nutrition Research Center (ANRC) because ASU cannot receive funds directly from GoFundMe.

Those of you who know her would not be surprised to hear that even in the first moments after her fall, Lizzy was taking charge of the situation, calming those around her and walking through next steps, and talking about a future in adaptive cycling. She was level-headed and brave during her entire rescue.   Lizzy has sustained a serious spinal cord injury to her T4 and T5 vertebrae and can no longer user her legs. This is a life-altering injury, and we all know the medical expenses for her long term recovery will soon seem insurmountable.

Inseparable from his little brother and best friend Griffin, the two are always together playing and watching sports. From cheering on the Bruins in the winter to keeping up on the golf course with his dad, GP (grandpa) and Uncle Cameron in the summer, he never tires or loses that big enthusiastic smile off his face.   Hunter has been diagnosed with DIPG, an extremely rare pediatric brain tumor. It is a highly aggressive and difficult to treat tumor, located in the area of the brainstem called the pons, which control the body's vital functions like breathing, blood pressure &amp; heart rate.   Hunter has been moved to Boston Children's Hospital where his family is being consulted and seen by the best doctors in the country as they explore clinical trial options.  Please help us support Hunter and the Barr/Hart family as they work through the best path forward for this amazing boy.     All of your generous donations will be put towards Hunter’s treatment.
